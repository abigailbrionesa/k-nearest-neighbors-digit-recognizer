Project 1

This project was fun.
For me, it was particularly interesting to classify digits (a foundational problem in AI) by putting into practice what we have covered during class, like encapsulation, modularity, loops, string and array manipulation.
I could follow each step, and it felt like an adventure. I could also research on my own about the real-world applications.
Because I was initially confused about how to approach the testing of the program, I revised the instructions of LAB3. 
After reading it, I remembered that I should do test cases and edge cases, so I did (logs are in tests.txt)
Also, I coded the functions in different files. Therefore, I used the skeleton code provided by the professor to have it organized and following the format.
I also talked to my TA on 23-09 to ensure the tests were functioning as expected.
